The analysis relies on two different but complementary sources of data: a panel survey of Polish firms for 2005-13, and an exporter-level customs data set, for the same period, with detailed information on products and destinations. The findings reveal that firms face high sunk costs for entering export markets, and that once these costs have been paid, they depreciate rapidly over time. Strong positive local spillovers are also identified, which help reduce entry costs.

Experimental Evidence from Benin,Najy Benhassine; David Mckenzie; Victor Maurice Pouliquen; Massimiliano Santini,,Entrepreneurship; Business regulation,2017,2016-11-01 00:00:00,"Governments around the world have introduced reforms to attempt to make it easier for informal firms to formalize. However, most informal firms have not gone on to become formal, especially when tax registration is involved. A randomized experiment based around the introduction of the entreprenant legal status in Benin is used to provide evidence from an African context on the willingness of informal firms to register after introducing a simple, free registration process, and to test the effectiveness of supplementary efforts to enhance the presumed benefits of formalization by facilitating its links to government training programs, support to open bank accounts, and tax mediation services. Few firms register when just given information about the new regime, but 9.6 percentage points more register when they were visited in person and the benefits were explained. The full package of supplementary efforts boosts the impact on the formalization rate to 16.3 percentage points, demonstrating that enhancing the benefits of formalization does induce more firms to formalize. Firms that are larger, and that look more like formal firms to begin with, are more likely to formalize, providing guidance for better targeting of such policies. However, formalization appears to offer limited benefits to the firms, and the costs of personalized assistance are high, suggesting that such enhanced formalization efforts are unlikely to pass cost-benefit tests.",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/579081480451260134/Can-enhancing-the-benefits-of-formalization-induce-informal-firms-to-become-formal-experimental-evidence-from-Benin,Sectors,Manufacturing,

32,Does the elimination of export requirements in special economic zones affect export performance? Evidence from the Dominican Republic,Fabrice Fernand Defever; Jose Daniel Reyes; Alejandro Riano; Miguel Eduardo Sánchez Martin,,Exports; Spatial growth/SEZs,2017,2016-10-01 00:00:00,"Special economic zones, one of the most important instruments of industrial policy in developing countries, often feature export share requirements. That is, firms located in these zones are obliged to export more than a certain stated share of their output to enjoy the wide array of incentives available there, a practice prohibited by the World Trade Organization. This paper exploits the staggered removal of export requirements across products and over time in the special economic zones of the Dominican Republic to evaluate whether the importance of exports originating from the zones was affected by the elimination of export requirements. The findings show that entry increased among firms in special economic zones, while the average value of export transactions fell for existing exporters following the reforms. At the same time, continuous exporters were unaffected by the policy change, possibly because these firms were not constrained by the export requirement.

An entrepreneur launches a campaignon a crowdfunding platform to pitch his or her idea to a largenumber of potential supporters for donations or investments. In North America and Europe, crowdfunding has emergedas a promising alternative for entrepreneurial finance. In particular, crowdfunding platforms are increasingly targeting the development and commercialization of clean technologiesin developing countries. Crowdfunding offers a new alternative to address the financing needs of capital intensive clean technology businesses in developing countries. To better understand crowdfunding’s potential and limitations, the World Bank Group’s Climate Technology Program interviewed a number of East African entrepreneurs who were early adopters of this new fundraising mechanism. From their successes and failures, key lessons were drawn for entrepreneurs, investors, and regulators. While the crowdfunding market in Africa is nascent, there are manyreasons to be optimistic about its future. As the market matures and grows, a number of interesting evolutions can be expedited by the collaborative efforts of the public and private sectors, suchas data collection, the matching fund model, and payment systeminnovation.In the clean technology sector, crowdfunding platforms face both opportunities and risks in their experiments to expand indeveloping countries. Ill-suited regulations in equity and debt crowdfunding, limited investor protection, and the lack of effective due diligence are among the barriers to expanding crowdfunding investment. Nevertheless, given the environmental and social goals of the businesses and the growing market opportunities,crowdfunding investment could play a catalytic role in financing clean technology ventures across the developing world.",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/402581470897987643/Crowdfunding-for-green-businesses-lessons-from-East-African-startups,Sectors; Innovation,Climate Competitiveness; Entrepreneurship,Kenya

In contrast to the traditional invention oriented approach to innovation, the potential exists to help these entrepreneurs scale rapidly through “open innovation”strategies featuring technology brokering and networking.In the invention-based approach, enterprises typically invest heavily in research and development (R&D) to be the first to develop and commercialize new ideas. They subsequently reap monopoly profits through commercialization of these ideas and claim intellectual property rights (IPR). However, this approachmay be challenging in developing countries given the highcosts involved and weak IPR enforcement frameworks, and often being first to market in the green sector does not requireradical invention. For these reasons, an innovation strategy giving prominence to technology absorption and adaptation of existing business models may represent an alternate, less capital- and time-intensive pathway to help green firms grow in developing countries. The World Bank Group’s Climate Technology Program undertook a literature review and an analysis of 14 case studies of different programs spanning more than 80 countries to understand how public programs could best support green firms to scale in parallel to government initiatives to improve innovative capacity. This research offers the following insights. (i) place the entrepreneur at the center of the innovation process; (ii) seek to cement peer-to-peer connections at the local level (e.g. by setting up networks of entrepreneurs); and (iii) help entrepreneurs connect to supranational networks and technology brokering platforms at the global level.",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/434281470900048448/Connecting-green-technology-entrepreneurs-implications-for-public-program-design,Innovation; Economy,Private Sector Investment,

This paper sheds light on the direct impact of technological as well as organizational innovation on firm level employment growth based on the theoretical model of Harrison, Jaumandreu, Mairesse, and Peters (2014) using a sample of over 15,000 firms in Africa, South Asia, Middle East and North-Africa and Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The results suggest that new sales associated with product innovations tend to be produced with just as much or higher levels of labor intensity. The effect is largest in lower income countries and the African region, where firms are further away from the technological frontier. More importantly, process innovations that involve automation of production do not have a short-term negative impact on firm employment. However, there is some evidence of a negative effect of automation on employment that manifests in increases in efficiency that reduce the elasticity of new sales to employment. Overall, these results are qualitatively similar to previous findings in advanced economies and highlight a positive direct role of innovation on the quantity of employment but at a decreasing rate as firms’ transition to the technological frontier.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/24857,Trade,Trade Outcomes,

This paper quantifies the impact of Internet adoption on international trade. It shows that the Internet has a positive, nuanced, impact on international trade: bilateral exports are more affected when Internet adoption increases in the exporter than importer. A 10 percent increase in the exporter's Internet adoption leads to a 1.9 percent increase in bilateral exports, largely explained by an increase in the number of goods exported. A 10 percent increase in the importer's Internet adoption leads to a 0.6 percent increase in bilateral exports, explained by an increase in the average value of existing exported goods. The analysis also finds that when both countries have high levels of Internet adoption they are more likely to trade with each other, compared with country pairs with different (high and low) or low levels of Internet adoption.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/24866,Innovation; Innovation,Entrepreneurship; Reform Progress,Kenya

The purpose of the note is to assess the main constraints facing informal firms, identify patterns of productivity and firm dynamics, and better understand drivers for formalization. Section one provides an overview of key characteristics and main investment climate constraints facing informal firms. In section two, patterns of informal firm finance are explored, while in sections three and four, labor productivity and drivers of firm growth are analyzed. Section five examines incentives to remain informal and policies that can catalyze formalization. This is followed by a conclusion. Due to the sampling methodology used, all results pertain to the sample of surveyed firms; hence, due caution is necessary in extrapolating the results to the broader informal sector in Kenya. Nevertheless, the assessment of the surveyed firms could provide important information on identifying policies as well as firm-level support that could boost productivity and catalyze formalization. This could have important implications for economic growth and job creation in Kenya.

Bangladesh’s ambition is to build on its very solid growth and poverty reduction achievements, and accelerate growth to become a middle income country by 2021, and share prosperity more widely amongst its citizens. This includes one of its greatest development challenges: to provide gainful employment to the over 2 million people that will join the labor force each year over the next decade. Moreover, only 54.1 million of its 94 million working age people are employed. Bangladesh needs to use its labor endowment even more intensively to increase growth and, in turn, to absorb the incoming labor. The Diagnostic Trade Integration Study identifies the following actions centered around four pillars to sustain and accelerate export growth: (1) breaking into new markets through a) better trade logistics to reduce delivery lags ; as world markets become more competitive and newer products demand shorter lead times, to generate new sources of competitiveness and thereby enable market diversification; and b) better exploitation of regional trading opportunities in nearby growing and dynamic markets, especially East and South Asia; (2) breaking into new products through a) more neutral and rational trade policy and taxation and bonded warehouse schemes; b) concerted efforts to spur domestic investment and attract foreign direct investment, to contribute to export promotion and diversification, including by easing the energy and land constraints; and c) strategic development and promotion of services trade; (3) improving worker and consumer welfare by a) improving skills and literacy; b) implementing labor and work safety guidelines; and c) making safety nets more effective in dealing with trade shocks; and (4) building a supportive environment, including a) sustaining sound macroeconomic fundamentals; and b) strengthening the institutional capacity for strategic policy making aimed at the objective of international competitiveness to help bring focus and coherence to the government’s reform efforts.

Russian exports to members of the ECU, primarily Kazakhstan, would increase by an estimated $194 million, measured against a 2008 baseline. The impact of NTMs in Russia and the ECU, though difficult to quantify, is potentially more important for the market than tariff changes, because of the significant divergence between the historical GOST standards and standards prevailing in most of Russia's trading partners.

Tepid growth over the past decade, the slowest in the region, has resulted in few jobs being created, leading to more Nepalese workers seeking opportunities abroad. Their remittances have helped reduce poverty in the country and finance increasingly large trade deficits. Like other inflows of foreign exchange, remittances have led to an appreciation of the real exchange rate. This has adversely affected export competitiveness and has had no positive effects on productivity (unlike foreign direct investment). This report attempts to determine the extent to which these obstacles can be alleviated by policy decisions, as well as exactly which policy decisions should be prioritized. The policy notes included in this report aim at supporting the National Trade and Integration Strategy (NTIS) through an evidence-based approach. To do so, these notes combine the following elements: (i) existing analysis on Nepal's competitiveness from different angles (including existing competitiveness assessments on transport, access to finance, the tourism sector, previous trade competitiveness reports, and so forth); (ii) international experience from comparator countries on good practices for trade policy reforms; (iii) new analysis for Nepal, applying cutting-edge methods on a wide set of databases; and (iv) field-level interviews with the private sector, and consultations with donors and the Government of Nepal.",https://hubs.worldbank.org/docs/imagebank/pages/docprofile.aspx?nodeid=26563867,Trade,Competition and Competition Policy,

Making the support to firms' internationalization a policy priority is commendable Countries around the world, and many countries in the South Asia region have incentives in place to help firms become exporters and succeed in diversifying their export markets.But not all interventions designed to support firms' internationalization work, so, evaluating impact is crucial.Some of the planned changes in the scheme introduced in 2013 revealed public-private dialogue. However, many of these changes have not been fully implemented. The fast-track system introduced in 2013, and by which, firms exporting priority products would not need to certify domestic value addition reflect the systematic feedback of the private sector on the complexity of proving value added content.At the firm level there is no evidence showing a clear link between the effective incentive rates received and export performance, or the changes in the export incentive scheme and performance. The main policy conclusion that emerges from this analysis is that the current incentive scheme needs to be revised. The rest of the note is structured as follows. Section two discusses aspects of the design of the allocation mechanism of the incentive. Section three shows the impact of the incentive program from the aggregate level, at the product level and at the firm level.",https://hubs.worldbank.org/docs/imagebank/pages/docprofile.aspx?nodeid=26564533,Trade; Investment,Competition and Competition Policy; Risk and Policy Uncertainty,Nepal
56,Policy note 5: Designing institutions to promote trade and investment in Nepal,Laura Gomez Mera,Trade,Trade policy; Investment policy,2016,2016-06-01 00:00:00,"As a small, landlocked economy, Nepal's development prospects are closely tied to its ability to increase integration in the regional and global marketplace. Despite significant changes in Nepal's trade sector over the past decade, the country's export performance has remained poor, with exports growing at a much slower pace than imports. Nepal's external vulnerability is deepened by its dependence on remittances to finance growing trade deficits.Achieving greater integration in the global economy and building a competitive export sector will require overcoming various economic and institutional challenges. This paper assesses the performance of these organizations in their role of promoting exports and investment. It has two main objectives. First, we describe the main export and investment promotion institutions in Nepal and examine their mandates, missions, and the services they offer.Second, we look at international best practices in export and investment promotion, to identify cost effective approaches appropriate for small developing countries. Based on this, we provide a number of recommendations for strengthening and improving the role of export and investment support organizations and initiatives in Nepal, as well as the level of coordination and cooperation among them. The report is organized as follows. In the next section, we briefly review the economic rationale for public intervention in the promotion of exports and investment and summarize the main findings of the literature regarding the most effective institutional designs and practices. We also discuss the arguments for and against a merger of the two activities within a single institution. Section three describes and assesses the institutional framework for export and investment promotion in Nepal. In Section four, we examine four case studies of “best practices” in the promotion of exports and export-oriented investment –Costa Rica, Jamaica, Colombia, and Latvia. We also discuss examples of successful promotion and development of the links between the tourism sector and exports, Mauritius, which offers some lessons for the case of Nepal.

Collecting data on firm-level innovation is challenging because of the subjective definition of what determines an innovation, a problem that is exacerbated in developing countries where innovation is likely to be more incremental and less radical. This paper contributes to the literature by presenting the results of an experiment aiming to identify the survey instrument that better captures firm-level innovation in developing countries. The paper shows that a small set of questions included in a multi-topic, firm-level survey does not provide an accurate picture of firm-level innovation and tends to overestimate innovation rates. Issues related to framing explain some of the unreliability of innovation responses, while cognitive problems do not appear to play a significant role.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/24531,Investment,Risk and Policy Uncertainty,Tajikistan

Prepared by the World Bank Group (WBG) in partnership with the African Competition Forum, the study reviews the implementation of competition frameworks in Africa and examines competition issues that affect market performance in three important sectors for Africa's competitiveness: cement, fertilizers, and telecoms. It uses the WBG's Markets and Competition Policy Assessment Tool to identify how competition rule and their enforcement could be made more effective, and to highlight economic and regulatory characteristics of cement, fertilizers and telecoms markets that dampen competition and increase the risk of anticompetitive business practices. Conservative estimates put forward by this report suggest that addressing weak competition in principle staple foods across three countries would have the effect of lifting around 500,000 people above the poverty line by lowering consumer prices. Fundamental market reforms to increase competition in key input services would also boost economic growth. For example, professional services reforms would deliver an additional 0.16–0.43 percent of additional annual gross domestic product growth. While the benefits of competition are clearly observable in Africa, considerable effort is still required to ensure effective implementation of competition laws and incorporation of competition principles in government policies.",https://hubs.worldbank.org/docs/imagebank/pages/docprofile.aspx?nodeid=26539089,Trade,Trade Outcomes,

Thanks to these changes, developing countries can now increase their participation in global value chains (GVCs) and thus become more competitive in agriculture, manufacturing and services. This is a paradigm shift from the 20th century when countries had to build the entire supply chain domestically to become competitive internationally. For policymakers, the focus is on boosting domestic value added and improving access to resources and technology while advancing development goals. However, participating in global value chains does not automatically improve living standards and social conditions in a country. This requires not only improving the quality and quantity of production factors and redressing market failures, but also engineering equitable distributions of opportunities and outcomes - including employment, wages, work conditions, economic rights, gender equality, economic security, and protecting the environment. The internationalization of production processes helps with very few of these development challenges. Following this perspective, Making Global Value Chains Work for Development offers a strategic framework, analytical tools, and policy options to address this challenge. The book conceptualizes GVCs and makes it easier for policymakers and practitioners to discuss them and their implications for development. It shows why GVCs require fresh thinking; it serves as a repository of analytical tools; and it proposes a strategic framework to guide policymakers in identifying the key objectives of GVC participation and in selecting suitable economic strategies to achieve them.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/24426,Sectors; Innovation,Climate Competitiveness; Entrepreneurship,

The paper finds that an average annual slowdown of gross domestic product in China of 1 percent over 2016–30 is expected to result in a decline of gross domestic product in Sub-Saharan Africa by 1.1 percent and globally by 0.6 percent relative to the past trends scenario by 2030. However, if China's transformation also entails substantial rebalancing, the negative income effects of the economic slowdown could be offset by the positive changes brought along by rebalancing through higher overall imports by China and positive terms of trade effects for its trading partners. If global supply responds positively to the shifts in relative prices and the new sources of consumer demand from China, a substantial rebalancing in China could have an overall favorable impact on the global economy. Economic growth could turn positive and higher on average, by 6 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa and 5.5 percent globally, as compared with the past trends scenario. Finally, rebalancing reduces the prevalence of poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa compared with the isolated negative effects of China's slowdown, which slightly increase the incidence of poverty. Overall, China's slowdown and rebalancing combined are estimated to increase gross domestic product in Sub-Saharan Africa by 4.7 percent by 2030 and reduce poverty, but the extent of this varies by country.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/24506,Trade; Trade,Competition and Competition Policy,Kenya

This paper decomposes trade costs into: (i) trade facilitation, (ii) non-tariff barriers, and (iii) the costs of business services. The paper assesses the poverty and shared prosperity impacts of deep integration to reduce these three types of trade costs in: (i) the East African Customs Union–Common Market of East and Southern Africa–South African Development Community ""Tripartite"" Free Trade Area; (ii) within the East African Customs Union; and (iii) unilaterally by the East African Customs Union. The analysis employs an innovative, multi-region computable general equilibrium model to estimate the changes in the macroeconomic variables that impact poverty and shared prosperity. The model estimates are used in the Global Income Distribution Dynamics microsimulation model to obtain assessments of the changes in the poverty headcount and shared prosperity for each of the simulations for the six African regions or countries. The paper finds that these reforms are pro-poor. There are significant reductions in the poverty headcount and the percentage of the population living in poverty for all six of the African regions from deep integration in the Tripartite Free Trade Area or comparable unilateral reforms by the East African Customs Union. Further, the incomes of the bottom 40 percent of the populations noticeably increase in all countries or regions that are engaged in the trade reforms. The reason for the poor share in prosperity is the fact that the reforms increase unskilled wages faster than the rewards of other factors of production, as the reforms tend to favor agriculture. Despite the uniform increases in income for the poorest 40 percent, there are some cases where the share of income captured by the poorest 40 percent of the population decreases. The estimated gains vary considerably across countries and reforms. Thus, countries would have an interest in negotiating for different reforms in different agreements.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/24498,Sectors,Climate Competitiveness,

Excessive reliance on remittances, export dependency on a few products, and insufficient domestic job creation make the Moldovan economy highly vulnerable to external conditions. As a small and open economy, Moldova’s development potential is linked to its trade and investment integration strategy. Moldova is situated between two large markets: the European Union (EU), which absorbs more than half of Moldova’s exports, and the Russian Federation. Reducing the economic distance to large regional markets and reaping the benefits of openness is key to overcoming Moldova's structural constraints and spurring export-led growth.

Its objectives are twofold: (i) to present a comprehensive analysis of Moldova’s recent trade performance and (ii) to identify policy measures and interventions that can enhance the competitiveness of Moldova’s export firms and the value added of their exports. The report is divided into two main parts. Part one contains an exports outcome analysis. It assesses export performance along four dimensions that contribute to form a comprehensive picture of the sustainable competitiveness of the export sector, including (i) the level, growth, and market share performance of existing exports (the “intensive margin”); (ii) diversification of products and markets (the “extensive margin”); (iii) the quality and sophistication of exports (the “quality” margin); and (iv) the survival of export flows (the “sustainability margin”). Part two investigates constraints on Moldova’s competitiveness, focusing specifically on a series of supply-side factors, such as the role of backbone and input services and utilities, and access to finance; and the business environment, particularly government regulations affecting trade and governance and institutional quality.

Since then, seven free economic zones offering tax and customs benefits have been established. This note assesses the static and dynamic economic benefits of the program in Moldova. The free economic zones have been successful in attracting investment from both domestic and foreign sources. The economic zones have become true export platforms, generating a five-fold increase in exported industrial production from the zones between 2004 and 2014. On average, employment in the economic zones had a robust growth in the last seven years and almost doubled since 2008. Evidence suggests that the economic zones have significantly contributed to the diversification of exports and to the changing structure of the Moldovan economy. The effect of the economic zones on domestic firms appears to be modest, however, and unlikely to contribute to the technological upgrading and sophistication of the Moldovan economy. Free economic zones tend to attract industrial activities requiring intensive use of human resources for certain operations. The economic impact of Moldovan free economic zones is ambiguous. Moldovan legislation provides sound and transparent provisions, but the main issue is how this legislation is implemented. The majority of recommendations are focused on streamlining the implementation process, making it easier for companies to operate. Here are the main recommendations for improving the zones : (i) the importance of fiscal incentives should be downgraded by shifting to targeted services for businesses; (ii) reduce corruption and increase accountability by establishing one-stop-shop procedures and elements; (iii) establish a proper mechanism for monitoring and reporting with the zones residents and administrator; (iv) empower the regulator with additional relevant institutional capacities and capabilities; (v) the role of residents in appointing the administrator should be determinant; and (vi) establish a proper mechanism for compensating residents of the zones for restrictive treatment of the real assets.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/24006,Investment; Sectors; Trade,Cost of Operations; Manufacturing; Trade Outcomes,Kyrgyz Republic

The initial chapter analyzes the gaps and opportunities the Kyrgyz NQI presents for capturing benefits of access to the enlarged common market across sectors. The next three chapters take an in-depth look at three high-growth sectors and identify adaptation priorities and opportunities. Agriculture, services, and garments are a large and growing share of exports and are the sectors most likely to be transformed by accession to the CU and the increased tariffs to countries outside the EEU. Services added 56 percent to GDP in 2013, while agriculture contributed 18 percent, and manufacturing 16 percent. Exports in the garment sector were close to US$200 million in 2013, employing over 150,000 workers. The main findings of each chapter are summarized below followed by a summary of recommendations. This report is relevant to the Kyrgyz experience as it highlights important differences both in terms of regulations and technical requirements. The report highlights differences between the EU and CU regulatory systems in approaches to food safety and legislation, but it also analyzes the differences in infrastructure aspects of the NQI, such as testing laboratories and certification mechanisms between the EU and CU. The Customs Union approach is based on end-product compliance to a speciﬁc technical regulation or standard, whereas the European Union relies on preventive measures and minimizing risks associated with each process throughout the complete food chain. In the CU food control system, food control bodies verify that the end-product meets the required technical specifications established by the government; in the EU system, end-product attributes such as size, color, shape, smell, and taste are generally left to the marketplace to judge if they are acceptable. Importantly, the report pinpoints specific technical requirements for EU food safety that differ from the CU requirements (microbiological criteria for foodstuff, contaminants in food; maximum residue limits for residues of pesticides, and pharmacologically active substances).",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/24252,Trade,Competition and Competition Policy,

This paper contributes to this literature by evaluating the impact of a program that focuses on enhancing competitiveness of small and medium enterprises in Brazil by providing coaching and consulting on management and production practices. Specifically, the paper tests whether the program induces treated firms to reorganize knowledge by adding more layers of different skills and competencies to their workforces. Using a unique firm-level dataset, the number of layers of the firms are compared before and after the program. The impact of the program is identified by relying on an instrumental variable approach, exploiting the quasi-experiment roll-out of its implementation, which was carried out at different times across Brazilian regions. The analysis finds that the program had an effect and that this effect is heterogeneous. The program is particularly effective in promoting the reorganization of firms with initially fewer layers. The results confirm another finding of the literature, namely that in re-organized firms inequality of wages increases, as firms pay higher wages in added higher layers than in pre-existing ones. Finally, these results are used to discuss how the change in firms' organization is positively correlated with export performance.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/24214,Innovation,Reform Progress,Mexico

Taking advantage of a novel firm-level data set on information and communications technology for Mexico, the study finds that firms facing higher competition appear to have more incentives to increase their use of information and communications technology. Accordingly, although there is indeed a positive relation between information and communications technology use and firm performance, this effect is greater for firms that face higher competition pressures, which is consistent with the theoretical predictions of the trade-induced technical change hypothesis.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/24201,Innovation; Economy,Entrepreneurship; Gender,
79,Opportunity versus Necessity: Understanding the Heterogeneity of Female Micro-Entrepreneurs,Gabriela Calderon; Leonardo Iacovone; Laura Juarez,,Entrepreneurship; Gender,2016,2016-04-01 00:00:00,"Entrepreneurs that voluntarily choose to start a business because they are able to identify a good business opportunity and act on it -- opportunity entrepreneurs -- might be different along various dimensions from those who are forced to become entrepreneurs because of lack of other alternatives -- necessity entrepreneurs. To provide evidence on these differences, this paper exploits a unique data set covering a wide array of characteristics, including cognitive skills, non-cognitive skills and managerial practices, for a large sample of female entrepreneurs in Mexico. Descriptive results show that on average opportunity entrepreneurs have better performance and higher skills than necessity entrepreneurs. A discriminant analysis reveals that discrimination is difficult to achieve based on these observables, which suggests the existence of unobservables driving both the decision to become an opportunity entrepreneur and performance. Thus, an instrumental variables estimation is conducted, using state economic growth in the year the business was set up as an instrument for opportunity, to confirm that opportunity entrepreneurs have higher performance and better management practices.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/24210,Trade,Competition and Competition Policy,Haiti

Preliminary data indicate that merchandise import growth was 1.7 percent in 2015, down from 3 percent in 2014. Recent trade developments should be seen in the context of a deceleration in trade growth since the early 2000s, and particularly since the global financial crisis. These developments reflected a combination of old and new cyclical factors as well as enduring structural determinants, such as the maturation of global value chains and the slower pace of trade liberalization. In particular, trade developments in Latin America and Eastern Europe and Central Asia mostly reflected lower imports of recession hit commodity exporters such as Brazil and Russia. Latin America contributed 6 percent to the downward pull in global imports in 2015. Except for Japan, imports and exports of advanced economies did not show signs of a significant downturn, but were sluggish. Lower commodity prices have reduced real incomes in commodity producers and led to a contraction in their imports from all regions, including China. At the same time, the gradual shift from investment to consumption in China, and the more significant contraction in its industrial production seen in early 2015, have reduced its imports from other regions, including commodity producers.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/23889,Innovation,Entrepreneurship,Jordan

In China, starting in the 1980s, special economic zones were used as a testing ground for the country's transition from a planned to a market economy, and they are a prime example of China's pragmatic and experimental approach to reforms. One of the great special economic zone success stories in China is the Suzhou Industrial Park, a modern industrial township developed in the early 1990s through a Sino-Singapore partnership. It is successful not just in the economic sense, but also in terms of urban and social development in an eco-friendly way. One key lesson is that in a weak market environment, a facilitating and reform-oriented host government, coupled with foreign expertise and knowledge as well as a ""whole value chain"" approach can go a long way in developing urban-industry well-integrated special economic zones.

The analysis reveals that markets in South Sudan are highly segmented. Price differences for narrowly defined products, across cities exceed in some cases 100 percent. In addition, price volatility increased substantially following the imposition of the trade restrictions with Sudan. This increase tends to hurt disproportionately the poor, who cannot smooth purchasing decisions over time because of liquidity constraints. Transportation costs explain almost half of the variation in food prices across space, and improving the quality of roads has a large potential to reduce prices in the most expensive towns. On the basis of this price effect, the simulations suggest that bringing all road quality across states to that of primary roads can yield a reduction in poverty from the rate of 51.7 percent in 2009 to between 42.8 and 46.9 percent. These estimates have to be interpreted as conservative, as they do not take into account the second-order effects of road construction from increased trade that will result from better road connectivity.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/23903,Trade,Competition and Competition Policy,South Africa

The update presents a candid assessment of South Africa’s economic prospects. With growth declining in per capita terms the NDP goals are moving further out of reach. South Africa urgently needs fundamental reforms to kick start growth and promote job creation. Advancing with reforms to improve the lives of South Africans is particularly attractive, since they hold the potential to boost growth and speed up poverty alleviation.

The Government of Ethiopia has created the growth and transformation plan (GTP), focusing on two overarching themes: fostering competitiveness and employment, and enhancing resilience and reducing vulnerabilities. This plan recognizes that for poverty reduction and economic growth to be sustainable, the Ethiopian economic structure will have to undergo a fundamental transformation. In accordance with a focus on poverty reduction and economic growth, the GTP has identified five main levers for change: public sector investment in infrastructure to lay the ground for private sector development, enhancement of policies and regulations to provide an environment conducive to competitiveness and productivity, expanding access to credit for small and medium size enterprises, provision of training and education to augment the supply of skilled labor, and improved access to land. Technological adoption and innovation will play a crucial role in delivering the goals laid out in the GTP. Participation in foreign markets also induces firms to become more innovative, a phenomenon known as learning through exporting, as observed among Ethiopian leather exporters. Another vital determinant of innovative activity is the accumulation of human capital and the skill level of the workforce. This study seeks: (i) to empirically analyze the extent of innovative activities that formal firms are undertaking in Ethiopia; (ii) to conduct a review of the existing innovation landscape; and (iii) to identify opportunities to foster innovations at the base of the pyramid (BoP) in Ethiopia. This study is structured as follows: chapter one gives introduction. Chapter two provides a detailed overview of the characteristics of growth and innovation, by providing key insights based on the enterprise survey analysis on the characteristics, motivations, operational and market environment and constraints of the innovators in Ethiopia. Chapter three assesses the innovation landscape in Ethiopia, by looking at the governmental and private agencies responsible to promote innovation, as well as active programs, and donor initiatives which may play a role in promoting firm level and pro-poor innovations.

Regional and industry patterns in emerging economies,Angel Melguizo; Jose Ramon Perea,Investment Climate,Productivity; Manufacturing/Services,2016,2016-01-01 00:00:00,"Most emerging economies are characterised by lagging levels of productivity. While economic growth has been robust in much of the emerging world during the last two decades, it has generally been grounded on factor accumulation, with marginal contributions from productivity. With the economic literature pointing to human capital and skills as a key conduit of productivity, the inability of firms to find the skills they need appears as a key brake on development. This paper aims to identify the dimensions where this skill gap is more prevalent, particularly across emerging regions and industries. We devise an empirical analysis that uses two alternative specifications based on limited dependent variable analysis. The results place Latin America as the emerging region where firms have the greatest problems derived from the lack of adequate skills, well ahead of emerging Asia and Europe, but also of sub-Saharan Africa. In terms of sectors, two advanced manufacturing industries (machinery and motor vehicles) are particularly affected by this relative scarcity of adequately trained workers. Policy recommendations hinge on the need to solve the mismatch between the provision of skills by educational systems and the needs of the economy.",http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/development/mind-the-skills-gap-regional-and-industry-patterns-in-emerging-economies_5jm5hkp7v145-en,,,

Tepid growth over the past decade, the slowest in the region, has resulted in few jobs being created, leading to more Nepalese workers seeking opportunities abroad. Their remittances have helped reduce poverty in the country and finance increasingly large trade deficits. Like other inflows of foreign exchange, remittances have led to an appreciation of the real exchange rate. This has adversely affected export competitiveness and has had no positive effects on productivity (unlike foreign direct investment).

Although anecdotal evidence suggests that nontariff measures raise trade costs and inhibit trade in the region, little is known about the magnitude of these economic effects. This paper uses a newly collected data set to quantify the incidence of sanitary and phytosanitary measures and technical barriers to trade in the region and benchmarks it with other parts of the world. The results indicate that the Central American region has the lowest prevalence of technical nontariff measures in the world. However, there is significant heterogeneity of trade-related regulations in Central America; for instance, 48 percent of Salvadoran imports are subject to at least one nontariff measure, compared with just 16 percent of Honduran imports. The paper estimates the impact of these technical measures on border prices and finds that the price impact of sanitary and phytosanitary measures is equivalent to an ad-valorem tariff of 11.6 percent. This price-rising effect is further investigated by looking in detail at the impact of sanitary and phytosanitary measures on the prices of beef, chicken meat, bread, and dairy products in Guatemala. The impact is estimated to be equivalent to an ad-valorem tariff of 68.4 percent, 51.4 percent, 22.0 percent, and 5.0 percent, respectively. The paper shows that efforts to streamline key sanitary and phytosanitary measures affecting these products by, for example, reducing the cost and time required to obtain sanitary registries, would likely reduce the Guatemalan urban extreme poverty rate from 5.07 percent to 4.91 percent.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/18359,Innovation; Trade,Entrepreneurship; Competition and Competition Policy,

Competitive domestic markets are necessary to boost Kenya's competitiveness. There are two pillars that sustain effective competition policy: (i) opening markets and removing anticompetitive regulation; and (ii) effectively enforcing competition law. The main focus of this report is the identification of regulations that could restrict competition and distort markets and business decisions, having a negative effect on Kenya's competitiveness and growth. This report contains results from a review of the regulatory framework in key areas identified using Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Product Market Regulation (PMR) indicators, the World Bank Group's framework to identify anticompetitive regulations, and interviews with stakeholders. This report is concerned only with certain regulations that affect market competition in select sectors and topical areas. The report stems from the policy dialogue with various Kenyan institutions, supported by the Kenya Investment Climate Program. This report contains three parts.

103,The Impact of Investment Policy in a Changing Global Economy: A Review of the Literature,Roberto Echandi; Jana Krajcovicova; Christine Zhenwei Qiang,Investment Climate,Investment policy,2016,2015-10-01 00:00:00,"Evidence shows that foreign direct investment can provide many benefits to host countries, including productivity improvements, better jobs, and knowledge transfer. Further, it can serve as a vehicle for transformation of domestic production and better integration with global value chains. Nonetheless, these benefits are not automatic. Investment policies are required to maximize the potential gains of foreign direct investment. One challenge is that there are different kinds of foreign direct investment, and each may have different economic, social, and environmental impacts. However, the literature analyzing foreign direct investment often tends to swing from an extremely case-specific focus — analyzing experiences in one particular country in a single sector during a given period — to lumping together the analysis as if it was a homogenous phenomenon. Investment policy formulation requires a framework sophisticated enough to differentiate between the various kinds of foreign direct investment, as well as potential challenges and benefits for development. It must also be simple enough to enable governments to organize and prioritize the multiple and complex variables affecting the maximization of investment benefits. This paper presents an overview of the literature on the impact of foreign direct investment. The paper argues that a logical framework is needed to organize existing evidence from research to fill gaps in the literature and make existing evidence more useful in targeting policy making.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/22859,Trade,Trade Facilitation,

Although pre-1990s preferential trade agreements mostly focused on tariff liberalization, recent agreements increasingly contain deep provisions in diverse areas, such as intellectual property rights, investment, and standards. At the same time, there has been a remarkable increase in the internationalization of production through foreign direct investment and outsourcing. This paper employs the Antràs and Helpman (2008) model of contractual frictions and global sourcing to study how deep trade agreements affect the international organization of production. The paper constructs new measures of the depth of preferential trade agreements and of vertical foreign direct investment to test the theory. Consistent with the model, the analysis finds evidence that the depth of trade agreements is correlated with vertical foreign direct investment, and that this is driven by the provisions that improve the contractibility of inputs provided by suppliers, such as regulatory provisions. Because this implication of the model is specific to the so-called “property rights” theory of the multinational firm, the findings provide empirical support to this approach vis-à-vis alternative theories of firm boundaries.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/22885,Trade,Trade Outcomes,Uruguay

Global Value Chains and the Exchange Rate Elasticity of Exports ,Swarnali Ahmed; Maximiliano Appendino; Michele Ruta,Trade,GVCs; Exports,2016,2015-09-01 00:00:00,"This paper analyzes how the exchange rate elasticity of exports has changed over time and across countries and sectors, and how the formation of global value chains has affected this relationship. The analysis uses a panel framework covering 46 countries over the period 1996-2012, and first finds evidence that the elasticity of manufacturing export volumes to the real effective exchange rate has decreased over time. The paper then examines whether the formation of supply chains has affected this elasticity using different measures of global value chain integration. Intuitively, as countries are more integrated in global production processes, a currency depreciation only improves the competitiveness of a fraction of the value of final goods exports. In line with this intuition, the analysis finds evidence that the rise of participation in global value chains explains on average 40 percent of the fall in the elasticity, and that corrections of the real effective exchange rate for participation in global value chains do not present the same decreasing pattern in elasticity.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/22440,Trade; Investment,Competition and Competition Policy; Risk and Policy Uncertainty,

The main priority of OECS governments is to enable a resumption in growth in a more sustainable, inclusive and resilient manner. As an important source of employment and a key economic pillar, tourism plays a significant role in resuming growth in the region. This pre-feasibility assessment demonstrated that a regional ferry system could make a positive contribution to tourism competitiveness in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), and that a proper feasibility assessment of a regional ferry is warranted. Demand for regional ferries is not new to the OECS, the region has had a regional ferry system in the past and there are a number of sub-regional or country-level ferry systems that are operational. In addition, there have been initial signs of interest from potential investors for financing a regional ferry. However, a lack of regional coordination as well as significant regulatory, infrastructural, and institutional challenges has affected the fate of many regional ferry proposals from potential investors. This paper serves as a background for a feasibility assessment of a regional ferry, providing evidence and preliminary data on the movement of people, cargo, prices of moving within the region and existing fleet of ferries. It assesses competitive effects of a regional ferry vis-a-vis the cruise industry and air travel.

Moreover, the expansion of innovative business models, such as mobile technology services, is indicative of the continents growth potential. However, Africa continues to be largely agrarian, with an economy that is underpinned by resource-driven growth and a large and expanding informal sector. Indeed, more than a decade of consistently high growth rates have not yet trickled down to significant parts of the population: nearly one out of two Africans continue to live in extreme poverty, and income inequality in the region remains among the highest in the world. What is more, across sectors - from agriculture to manufacturing and services - productivity levels remain low.

Todays economy is unquestionable global. Trade as a proportion of global GDP has approximately doubled since 1975. Markets for goods and services have become increasingly integrated through a fall in trade barriers, with technology helping drive trade costs lower. But trade is not an end in itself. People measure the value of trade by the extent to which it delivers better livelihoods, through higher incomes, greater choice, and a more sustainable future, among other benefits. For the extreme poor living on less than $1.25 a day, the central value of trade is its potential to help transform their lives and those of their families. In this way, there is no doubt that the integration of global markets through trade openness has made a critical contribution to poverty reduction. The number of people living in extreme poverty around the world has fallen by around one billion since 1990. Without the growing participation of developing countries in international trade, and sustained efforts to lower barriers to the integration of markets, it is hard to see how this reduction could have been achieved.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/22081,Trade,Connectivity,

Staple foods are the main source of calories in Africa and in West Africa. In that region, rice, followed by maize and cassava, provides the main source of calories in coastal countries, with millet and sorghum being an important source of food in Sahelian countries (Haggblade et al. 2012).

The report highlighted research that demonstrated how poor logistics added roughly a 10 percent production cost penalty in Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Zambia across the five subsectors of light manufacturing where opportunities were identified as greatest in Africa. The report outlined how in Africa poor trade logistics increase production costs (often wiping out the labor cost advantage) and lead to long and unreliable delivery times, making local firm’s unattractive suppliers to lead firms in global value chains (GVCs), particularly for light manufacturing. This note seeks to contribute to a review of progress in achieving export diversification through greater exports of light manufacturing products. It looks at recent trends in the exports of the five categories of light manufacturing identified as having strong potential in Africa.

This paper reports the results from a survey of 153 freight forwarding firms in Serbia. Respondents report on firm characteristics, operational choices, and conditions at the border posts and terminals where imported goods are cleared for release. One key purpose of the study is to investigate operational trade-offs between time and cost that arise when import shipments are in transit. In three of four hypotheticals, respondents suggest that money savings dominate time savings. Responses regarding real operational decisions such as route choices reinforce this finding. Respondents also reported penalty rates for late delivery of import shipments as well as the value of a typical import shipment. From these responses, it is estimated that the contracted value of one additional (unexpected) day of delivery time in Serbia appears to be approximately 1 percent of the value of the underlying shipment.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/22185,Innovation,Reform Progress,

Since 1980, through good years and bad years, increases in exports have been positively associated with increases in national income. Zimbabwe's location and resource base, together with a low-cost but relatively well educated labor force, have endowed it with a naturally high trade ratio built on a diversified base that facilitates using trade as an engine of growth. While trade volumes have rebounded smartly from the deep recession of 2007-2008, these do not offset other worrisome longer-term trends: 1) export growth during the last decade has been lackluster and failed to drive high growth; 2) agricultural exports, other than tobacco, have lost their once dominant role in the region, and are no longer a source of diversification; 3) manufacturing has withered in a continuing secular decline; and 4) Zimbabwe's export basket has become less diversified and more dependent on a narrow range of mineral and, to a lesser extent, agricultural products. In short, exports have become less diversified, less-technologically sophisticated, and less labor-intensive, and ever more dependent on a few large mining activities to provide foreign exchange and employment. This report traces the roots of this poor performance to several policy issues: poor predictability of macroeconomic policy and economic governance has created an unfavorable climate for private investment and trade; a tariff structure that dampens export profitability; industrial policies (indigenization policy in particular) that undermine investor confidence and inhibits private investment; and finally, competition-limiting policies toward services that limit connectivity of Zimbabweans and raise trade costs. The good news arising from the study is that the remedies for these policy shortcomings lie in Zimbabwean hands. If the government were to adopt reforms that reconfigure economy-wide incentives and trade and industrial policies, it could promote sustained growth, economic diversification and empowerment of poor people.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/21985,Investment; Innovation,Cost of Operations; Entrepreneurship,Belarus; Russian Federation; Kazakhstan

As of April 2015, there are 406 regional trade agreements (RTAs) in force worldwide, more than double the number in force in 2000. These agreements cover over half of international trade. Countries engage in regional cooperation for a variety of reasons. First, it is easier to achieve agreement among a small number of regional partners than it is globally. Second, regional cooperation takes advantage of existing natural tendencies for regional trade that arise from geography and shared culture. This reinforces the regional division of labor already taking place among firms. Global value chains, in which lead firms organize a division of labor for complex products among many countries, often turn out to have a regional focus. Think, for example, of the electronics value chain in East Asia, and the automotive value chains focused on the United States, Germany, and Japan. South Asia itself is a small but growing part of value chains in textiles and apparel with both regional depth and cross-linkages to East Asia. This piece will focus on four aspects of trade liberalization (trade facilitation, non-tariff measures/barriers, intra-regional investment, and energy cooperation) that go beyond traditional preferential tariff reduction to illustrate both the potential of south-south liberalization and some of the particular challenges faced by South Asia.

The study makes recommendations on how to unleash the power of special economic zones and industrial zones in Africa through strategically leveraging the Chinese experiences. The success factors of Chinese special economic zones include the strong and long-term commitment of the government, a conducive business environment in the zones, strategic locations, technology upgrading and skills training, and strong linkages with the local economy. However, the Chinese experiences highlight some pitfalls to avoid, such as the “mushroom approach” and high-level overlaps at the later stage, environmental degradation, and the unbalance between industrial development and social dimensions. This calls for a bigger role for the market. Sub-Sahara Africas experience with traditional economic zones has been relatively poor, except in a few countries, such as Mauritius. The key challenges include the poor regulatory and institutional framework, lack of effective strategic planning, weak governance and implementation capacity, and inadequate infrastructure, among others. Since 2006, China has implemented special economic zone projects globally, including in four countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is still too early to conduct a full assessment of these projects; however, the evidence shows that some zones have begun to attract investments and make important contributions to the local economy. The main challenges include access to land, regulatory barriers, resettlement and coordination issues, and lack of external infrastructure.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/21854,Trade,Trade Outcomes,
142,Champions Wanted: Promoting Exports in the Middle East ,Melise Jaud; Caroline Freund,Trade,Exports,2015,2015-04-01 00:00:00,"While other emerging regions were thriving, MENA's aggregate export performance over the past two decades has been consistently weak. Using detailed firm-level export data from Customs administrations, this report explains why. One central finding is that the size distribution of MENA's exporting firms is suggestive of a critical weakness at the top. With the exception of the top firm, MENA's elite exporters are smaller and weaker compared to their peers in other regions. The largest exporter is alone at the top-Zidane without a team. MENA countries have failed to nurture a group of export superstars which critically contribute to export success in other regions. Part of the reason behind weak export performance is the lack of a competitive real exchange rate. The deleterious effects of an uncompetitive currency can be traced all the way down to the firm, hurting expansion at the intensive and extensive margin and preventing the emergence of export take-offs. The lack of heavy weight exporters at the top of the distribution also reflects the region's failure to push for trade and business climate reforms energetically. Finally, MENA's prevalent cronyism and corruption under pre-Arab Spring regimes (at least) confirms that business-government ties led to distortionary allocation of favors and rent dissipation by beneficiary firms, with little evidence that those firms developed into national champions or helped lift the region's export performance. The possibility of state capture in itself should call for caution when advocating any form of government intervention. In contrast, some interventions, like export promotion programs show effects on small exporters. However, because these firms are marginal in trade, such programs cannot be game changers. More broadly, the success of MENA countries in promoting export growth and diversification as well as generating jobs depends heavily on their ability to create an environment where large firms can invest and expand exports and new, efficient firms can rise to the top.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/21638,Trade,Competition and Competition Policy,Romania

This paper exploits a dramatic reduction in the rate of physical inspections by Albanian customs to estimate the effects of fewer inspection-related delays on the level and composition of imports. In this setting, the paper finds evidence that the expected median number of days spent in Albanian customs falls by 7 percent when the probability that a shipment is inspected falls from 50 percent or more to under 50 percent. In turn, this reduction in time produces a 7 percent increase in import value. The paper finds evidence that the reforms favored imports from preferential trading partners, especially the European Union. There are also reform-induced changes in the composition of trade, including increases in average quantities and unit prices, the number of shipments, and the number of importing firms per product-country pair and the number of countries per firm-product pair. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the estimate of 7 percent import growth along an intensive margin is roughly consistent with a 0.36 percentage point reduction in average tariff equivalent trade costs. Applying this figure to the value of Albania's non-oil imports produces a reform-induced trade cost savings estimate of approximately US$12 million in 2012.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/21649,Trade,Competition and Competition Policy,

In most of the region, business registration in a national registry is separate from tax registration. This paper provides initial results from an experiment in Malawi that randomly allocated firms into a control group and three treatment groups: a) a group offered assistance for costless business registration; b) a group offered assistance with costless business registration and (separate) tax registration; and c) a group offered assistance for costless business registration along with an information session at a bank that ended with the offer of business bank accounts. The study finds that all three treatments had extremely large impacts on business registration, with 75 percent of those offered assistance receiving a business registration certificate. The findings offer a cost-effective way of getting firms to formalize in this dimension. However, in common with other studies, information and assistance has a limited impact on tax registration. The paper measures the short-term impacts of formalization on financial access and usage. Business registration alone has no impact for either men or women on bank account usage, savings, or credit. However, the combination of formalization assistance and the bank information session results in significant impacts on having a business bank account, financial practices, savings, and use of complementary financial products.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/23653,Trade,,
151,The Global Trade Slowdown:  Cyclical or Structural?,Cristina Constantinescu; Aaditya Matu; Michele Ruta,Trade,Trade,2015,2015-01-01 00:00:00,"This paper focuses on the sluggish growth of world trade relative to income growth in recent years. The analysis uses an empirical strategy based on an error correction model to assess whether the global trade slowdown is structural or cyclical. An estimate of the relationship between trade and income in the past four decades reveals that the long-term trade elasticity rose sharply in the 1990s, but declined significantly in the 2000s even before the global financial crisis. These results suggest that trade is growing slowly not only because of slow growth of gross domestic product, but also because of a structural change in the trade-gross domestic product relationship in recent years. The available evidence suggests that the explanation may lie in the slowing pace of international vertical specialization rather than increasing protection or the changing composition of trade and gross domestic product",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/21144,Trade,Trade Outcomes,Georgia
152,Survival Is for the Fittest: Export Survival Patterns in Georgia,Antonio Martuscelli; Gonzalo Varela,Trade,Exports,2015,2015-01-01 00:00:00,"This paper analyzes the determinants of export flow survival in Georgia. The paper uses a unique Georgian firm-level data set, in which firms' characteristics and output dynamics are matched with their customs' export transactions, for the period 2006-12. A discrete survival model is used to explore the role of firm level characteristics, diversification strategies, and network effects on the survival rates of export flows. Low survival rates at the product level are found to limit the ability of Georgian firms to consolidate new products in international markets. The analysis finds that it is production efficiency, rather than size, that boosts export survival chances, that firms diversification strategies matter for the prospects of survival, and that there is strong evidence of network effects in export survival. The analysis also finds that ratified foreign trade agreements contribute to increase the survival of export flows by reducing policy-induced trading costs and increasing information about destination markets.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/21380,Trade; Sectors,Manufacturing,

Services are a key input in countries’ trade competitiveness, as well as a new source of trade diversification, making it critical to understand what factors and main constraints matter most for services competitiveness. The Toolkit provides a framework, guidelines, and set of practical tools to conduct a thorough analysis and diagnostic of trade competitiveness in the services sector with a methodology that sheds light on a country’s ability both to export services and improve its export performance through policy change. This Toolkit is designed to be used in a modular way. Either a full country diagnostic can be undertaken or various parts of the toolkit can be used to address specific questions of interest, whether they pertain to existing services performance, the potential for expansion and growth in services trade, or policy options to increase competitiveness in services trade. The output of an STCD can be used to assess either the overall performance of a country’s services sector or the performance of individual sub-sectors. This Toolkit complements the analytical framework for trade in goods provided by the Trade Competitiveness Diagnostic Toolkit (World Bank, 2012), and allows policymakers and experts in developing countries to better integrate services into their overall trade strategies.

154,Competition in Kenyan markets and its impact on income and poverty: A case study on sugar and maize ,Jonathan Argent; Tania Begazo,Trade,Competition policy,2015,2015-01-01 00:00:00,"This paper investigates the link between competitive, well-functioning food markets and consumer welfare. The paper explores two key food markets in Kenya -- sugar and maize -- and argues that a variety of factors conspire to distort market prices upward. Distortionary factors include import tariff policy, nontariff barriers, potential anticompetitive conduct by firms, and direct state intervention in markets. Changes in sugar and maize prices are shown to have significant welfare effects on consumers. Equivalent income effects are estimated using the most recent available representative household survey data -- the Kenya Integrated Household Budget Survey 2005/06. The paper shows that relaxing trade barriers to allow sugar prices to fall by 20 percent could reduce poverty by 1.5 percent. Similarly, adjusting government interventions in the maize market, which have been shown to inflate maize prices by 20 percent on average, could reduce poverty by 1.8 percent. The magnitude of the estimated income effects may vary based on updated household-level consumption data, assumptions regarding demand elasticities, and estimates of import parity prices for these staples. However, in all the scenarios, more competitive prices have a larger average effect on the poorest households in urban and rural areas, supporting the relevance of effective competition policies for poverty reduction strategies.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/21395,Economy,Economic and Social Context,

This note cites recent studies in arguing that the micro-health sector needs to be better understood. A more evidence based approach may enable the World Bank Group to better target investments and interventions and help these providers fulfill an important role serving the poor. The following recommendations are made at the conclusion of this paper: (1) Effort, rather than hardware or training, may count the most.

159,Trading Away from Conflict:  Using Trade to Increase Resilience in Fragile States,Massimiliano Cali,Trade,Trade policy; Fragile and conflict,2015,2014-12-01 00:00:00,"While economic growth in developing countries over the last ten years has lifted more people out of poverty than in any previous time, more than one billion people still live in countries affected by violent conflict. Conflict weakens governance, undermines economic development and threatens both national and regional stability. Trade shocks, in particular, can have widely varying impacts on conflict. This report sets out to empirically test these linkages between trade shocks and conflict via cross-country and intra-country analysis. On the basis of the analysis, it offers trade-related policy directions to reduce this risk in fragile economies. The results provide convincing evidence that trade and trade policy have a large impact on the risk and intensity of conflict. This report is composed of three main chapters. Chapter 1 develops a conceptual framework mapping the different channels through which trade may affect conflict and political stability. The framework is based on simple economic theory and the available empirical evidence on the impact of trade related changes on conflict and stability. It then tests this framework empirically through the analysis of cross-country data and through case studies of Nigeria and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The hope is that these types of intra-country analyses could be replicated in other countries, since they use data that are available in different countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Chapter 2 uses the same conceptual framework to show how differences in underlying conditions affect the relationship between trade-related changes and conflict. Following a review of the literature on the drivers of conflict, it examines the importance of four groups of grievances: conditions in neighboring countries, factors increasing grievance, government institutions, and policies that affect the transmission of changes in international prices to the domestic market. These relationships are tested using cross-country data and case studies of Nigeria and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Finally, chapter 3 uses the existing evidence, as well as evidence generated in this report, to discuss how the policies governing trade can reduce the probability and intensity of conflicts. Two appendixes include detailed information on the modeling framework, the data issues and the estimation results.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/20713,Sectors,Tourism,

Over the past few years, the private sector has been a central innovator in forging business partnerships with local communities for tourism purposes around the world. Having demonstrated some extraordinary development results, joint ventures increasingly need to demonstrate their commercial viability over the long term. Moving out of the donor and grant-funded sphere and into the competitive capital markets in search of finance has posed a significant challenge. The author have observed that many community joint venture partnerships contain high levels of risk and that this risk usually is too high for banks to assume. The author have learned that this risk could be reduced to more acceptable levels in a number of ways, notably through better market-orientation and a more competitive enabling environment.

162,Trade Policy and Food security:  Improving Access to Food in the Wake of High World Prices ,Ian Gillson; Amir Fouad,Trade,Trade policy,2015,2014-11-01 00:00:00,"Based on forecasts of global population growth, food security will remain an important economic development issue over the next several decades. In addition, real food prices have risen in recent years after decades of decline, bringing the issue of food security even further into the public spotlight. However, there is no global food shortage: the problem is one of moving food, often across borders, from surplus production areas to deficit ones at prices that low-income consumers in developing countries can afford. Trade can be an excellent buffer for domestic fluctuations in food supply. World output of a given food commodity is far less variable than output in individual countries so increased trade integration holds considerable potential to stabilize food prices, boost returns to farmers and reduce the prices faced by consumers. Trade liberalization protects national food markets against domestic shocks by allowing more food to be imported in times of shortage and exported in periods of plenty. Historically, however, most countries have chosen to take the opposite approach by restricting imports of food and discouraging exports to keep domestic markets isolated from international shocks. Food commodity markets, therefore, remain highly distorted despite the wave of liberalization that has swept world trade since the 1980s. In addition to examining the determinants of recent food price spikes, Trade Policy and Food Security explores the impact of food prices on economic welfare, and how the effect of price changes on food security and economic welfare in developing countries can be mitigated through appropriate national policies at the border. It highlights the importance of both the extension and continued application of existing WTO disciplines on trade-distorting agricultural trade policies as a key resolution to the collective action problem witnessed during the recent food price spikes, whereby unilateral border policies--especially export controls--simply exacerbated the initial price increases.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/20537,Investment; Innovation,Cost of Operations; Entrepreneurship,

However, disparities in initial resource endowments of male and female-led firms, sector sorting into low productivity activities, social norms, and institutional arrangements, constrain the growth of female-led enterprises. This note reviews the outcomes of programs supporting female growth entrepreneurs and draws lessons from available evidence to inform the design of more effective programs. The review shows that most programs are primarily geared toward microenterprises, making it difficult to draw conclusions about program design for growth-oriented entrepreneurs, but some early findings point the way forward. Management practices appear to improve as a result of business education, but there is little robust evidence to prove that support programs lead to significant improvements in business performance outcomes. Furthermore, in programs with both male and female participants, firm performance improves in some cases for male-led firms only, not for female-led firms. The note concludes by suggesting the need for more experimentation in the design and delivery of services and a new focus on strengthening the engendering of support programs to more specifically address gender-specific constraints such as social norms, entrepreneurial preferences, and institutional arrangements, changing public discourse, and paying more attention to factors that induce female entrepreneurs to diversify into higher value-added activities. Offering mentoring, networking, and other consulting services, in addition to education on basic business practices and strengthening critical areas such as gender-specific content, can potentially increase the effectiveness of these programs.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/23654,Innovation; Investment; Economy,Entrepreneurship; Risk and Policy Uncertainty; Private Sector Investment,

It finds that the current landscape of employment and private sector activity in developing countries indicates a number of potential channels through which investment climate reforms can positively affect job creation. However, rigorous empirical evidence is scarce and most of the relevant studies focus on business entry reforms with a few focusing on business taxation and investment promotion activities. Overall, there is evidence of job creation through business entry, tax reforms, and investment promotion activity in developing countries. Almost all of these evidences are from quasi-experimental studies that are significant improvements over conventional cross-country or cross-section panel data analysis. Still, various endogeneity concerns in these studies cannot be ruled out completely. In assessing job effects, future research should provide deeper insights on the gross versus net and short-run versus long-run job effects and general equilibrium effects of various investment climate reforms related to jobs, productivity, competition, and other developmental outcomes. Another critical agenda for future research is to shed light on which investment climate reforms matter most for spurring the employment and productivity growth of firms in developing countries.

It concerns itself not only with the launch of new businesses but more generally with the transfer of new products, knowledge, and services into rural space. Faced with the challenge of finding technologies that match rural requirements, Villgro has linked marketable product and service concepts from diverse sources with entrepreneurs who have start-up experience - so-called serial entrepreneurs. Other incubators may have difficulty imitating Villgro's business model. The conditions for its development are unique, its management approaches are relatively untested, and the values of its management team are deeply intertwined with perceptions of how the rural business system operates in India. However, other startup incubators can learn from Villgro the importance of getting management basics right before attempting to transform an entire agricultural sector. Good governance, transparency, accountability, building teams around highly capable employees, and continuously enhancing management skills are important no matter the strategic orientation of the emerging incubator.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/20110,Investment,Entry and Investment,
177,New Voices in Investment:  A Survey of Investors from Emerging Countries,Laura Gomez Mera; Thomas Kenyon; Yotam Margalit; Jose Reis; Gonzalo Varela  ,Investment Climate,FDI,2015,2014-08-01 00:00:00,"One out of every three dollars invested abroad in 2012 was originated in multinationals from developing countries. This study sheds light on the characteristics, motivations, strategies, and needs of emerging market investors. By including information on investors, potential investors, and non-investors, the study identifies differentiating factors among them that are associated with investment decisions. Results show that emerging market investors are active players in international trade markets; they operate predominantly in manufacturing, and are publicly listed and larger than non-investors. They exhibit a strong regional bias: they invest more heavily in neighbors and in other countries in their own regions. Outward FDI from emerging markets is primarily market-seeking. Expanding regional and host markets emerged as the most important factor influencing the location of investments. However, emerging markets' firms face binding costs of investing in distant, culturally dissimilar markets, resulting, in practice in a trade-off between market size and market familiarity. Transaction costs associated with geographical and cultural differences have a greater impact on services sector firms that exhibit a stronger regional bias. Bilateral investment treaties (BITs) partly offset these costs associated with investing in faraway and/or unfamiliar markets. In addition, international trade agreements increase the perceived attractiveness of a host country to potential investors. Political factors constitute binding constraints that deter emerging markets' firms from investing in developing markets. Yet, investors value political stability and transparency more than corruption control, fair and regular elections, and risk of expropriation in the host country. IPAs play only a marginal role in raising awareness of investment opportunities in developing countries, and may be particularly ineffective in many African countries. Nevertheless, IPAs appear to be a widely used and useful resource for investors once they have made the decision to enter a specific market. IPA services tend to be more valuable for smaller and less productive firms. Overall, the new TNCs from emerging economies do not appear to differ dramatically from their predecessors from developed and developing countries in previous waves of OFDI. Results suggest that to attract FDI from emerging economies, countries need to maintain market-friendly, liberal trade and investment policies. In addition, joining international trade and investment agreements can be benefitial to reduce transaction costs associated with cross border investment. Countries also need to provide a stable and predictable political and institutional environment. Last and not least, it is important to revamp IPAs and increase their effectiveness in raising awareness of investment opportunities and meeting investors' needs.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/20605,Investment; Investment,Entry and Investment; Cost of Operations,

These may be public officials, development organization staff, or consultants working in investment promotion, industrial development, or general economic development. Borrowing heavily from lessons learned in Bank Group projects, this toolkit helps project leaders to develop and execute actual targeting campaigns, by providing a step-by-step guide and, through the appendices, practical tools for implementation. The tools are in the form of templates, research resources, and examples of materials for investors. The toolkit is divided into four chapters corresponding to four essential steps in the targeting process. They are: step 1) understanding the context for a sector targeting campaign (also known as scoping); step 2) identifying competitive subsectors that might be best placed to attract new investments (also known as a sector scan); step 3) planning a targeting campaign aimed at the selected subsectors; and step 4) executing a targeting campaign and following up.

This paper assesses the impediments to market integration in Central and Eastern Africa for three food staples: maize, rice, and sorghum. The paper uses a large database on monthly consumer prices for 150 towns in 13 African countries and detailed data on the length and quality of roads linking the towns. The analysis finds a substantial effect of distance and share of paved road on the level of market integration, as measured by relative prices. Furthermore, the paper evaluates the additional domestic and cross-border impediments to market integration in the region and represents them on a regional map. The analysis finds heterogeneous levels of domestic market integration across countries and significant ""border effects"" for the majority of contiguous countries in the sample, which reveal that markets are more integrated within than between countries. Countries that are members of the same regional trade agreement have substantially ""thinner"" borders with other members. Finally, the analysis shows that countries with less integrated domestic markets and ""thicker"" borders with their neighbors also have a higher prevalence of food insufficiency. These findings support policy efforts in tackling domestic and border impediments to transactions such as reforming customs, simplifying nontariff measures, addressing corruption, improving the quality of roads, and deepening regional trade agreements.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/19340,Innovation; Innovation,Entrepreneurship; Entrepreneurship,

It can open up new markets on opposite sides of borders and give consumers wider access to cheaper goods. This paper uses data from five contiguous districts of India, Nepal, and Bangladesh in the northeast of the subcontinent to measure the degrees of trade complementarity between districts. The paper illustrates that the regions are underexploiting the potential of intraregional commerce. Price wedges of up to 90 percent in some important consumption products along with measures of complementarity between households' production and consumption suggest the potential for relatively large gains from deeper trade integration. Furthermore, an examination of a specific supply chain of tea highlights factors that help industries scale up, aided by institutions such as an organized auction and decent physical and legal infrastructure. However, districts alike in geography but located across international boundaries face different development prospects, suggesting that gains from reduced ""thickness of borders"" would not accrue automatically.

Global flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) declined severely during the recent economic and financial crisis. As the crisis eased, recovery in world economies spurred a resurgence of FDI, and that in turn reignited competition for investments among host countries. Especially in emerging markets, governments long have prized FDI as a source of much-needed capital and jobs. But in the 21st century, governments value FDI as much or more as a source of technology and know-how. Policymakers have witnessed how knowledge brought by foreign investors can spill over to local firms, bolster skills in the local workforce, and thus increase the overall competitiveness of their economies. To foster development of intellectual capital as well as businesses and jobs, governments increasingly recognize the importance of cultivating FDI. Providing business and investment climate information is a crucial component of IPI activities in all economies. But IPIs can gain particular advantage in those settings where investors find it most difficult to obtain reliable information and meet bureaucratic requirements. Research shows, for example, that investment promotion is more effective in economies where English is not an official language, and in economies that are more culturally distant from the investors corporate homes. Investment promotion also has more impact in countries with less effective governments and in economies that erect more barriers to launching a business (such as more time to obtain a construction permit). In this 2012 edition, GIPB focuses specifically on information provision in two sectors, tourism and agribusiness. This focus should be of particular use to economies that seek or are considering seeking FDI in those sectors.",https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/20423/907580WP0v20Bo0n0Best0Practices0web.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y,Economy,Economic and Social Context,

Noting that this was an issue related to the country's investment climate, the IC team in Istanbul incorporated the IS perspective into their country-level tax program and went on to explore how further targeted IC interventions could open doors for investments of IFC as well as of other financial institutions. The first step was to understand how often and why deals get dropped as a result of similar investment climate constraints. This smart lesson demonstrates how Advisory Services (AS) and Investment Services (IS) teams can research policy-level issues in their region and sector, using the main findings to inform future project-level alignment. The smart lesson can also be used more generally to design and implement internal surveys to identify strategic institutional priorities.",https://hubs.worldbank.org/docs/imagebank/pages/docprofile.aspx?nodeid=16764721,Investment,Entry and Investment,

Governments that do not recognize this trend pay a high price in lost investments. Confronting political and regulatory risks as part of the investment climate is thus crucial for countries to make their business environments more competitive.This brief note suggests reforms that can have immediate impacts: addressing ex ante and ex post issues in the legal and regulatory framework to protect investors, mitigating risks at the sector level, managing reputational and integrity risks at the project level, and issuing financial instruments to ease short-term impediments in the investment climate.",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/351251468336718273/pdf/682950NEWS0Inv00Box367908B00PUBLIC0.pdf,Innovation,Entrepreneurship,
220,Global Analysis of General Trade and Operational Licensing,Investment Climate Department of the World Bank Group,,Business regulation,FY12,2012-03-01 00:00:00,"This paper examines the general purpose licensing imposed by central or local authorities, and the need to eliminate unnecessary licensing regulations imposed on businesses. This paper does not address the issue of reform of sector-specific or professional licensing regulation, but provides criteria and tools for identifying unnecessary licensing regulations, and their elimination or, in some instances, for changing licensing regulations to free notifications. Indeed, this paper argues that a simplified review of licensing regimes that identifies unnecessary licensing saves energy and resources for well-balanced reform of remaining licensing regulations, eventually providing better protection for the public at large and a more enabling business environment. This paper is primarily oriented towards reform practitioners from governments that intend to reform their business environments; development agencies; donor-funded projects; practitioners of licensing reforms; and others interested in improving state and local governance. This paper is divided into three parts: (1) overview of licensing practices that provides common definitions of licensing, analysis of justified licensing regimes with focus on criteria for their justification, and theoretical overview of unjustified and questionable licenses; (2) analysis of commonly declared functions of unjustified licenses that provides insight into the nature of these licenses and their typology; and (3) four case studies that examine how unjustified licenses can be reformed with examples of unsuccessful, partially successful, and successful reform efforts. The analytical conclusions of this paper summarize criteria for unjustified licenses; describe lessons learned from the reform efforts; and provide a practical set of recommendations to the interested parties.    his publication provides criteria for identifying unnecessary licensing regulations, an overview of reform practices, and lessons learned from efforts to rationalize licensing",http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/188421468339618791/pdf/770980WP0Box370mate0Global0Analysis.pdf,Trade,Trade Facilitation,Armenia

This handbook provides an overview of efforts and achievements in subnational investment climate reforms. It is organized as follows. Chapter 2 reviews a number of countries experiences with subnational reforms, noting both success stories and disappointments and pointing toward lessons learned. Chapter 3 sets out the basic principles of subnational revenue, including business taxation. Chapter 4 describes sound licensing practices for subnational governments, including establishing licensing fees. Chapter 5 provides recommendations for subnational reform projects where both the regulatory authority and taxation require attention, which is the most common situation.

Licenses and Regulations","Wille, John R.; Magalhaes, Numa De",,Business regulation,FY12,2011-08-01 00:00:00,"Open data initiatives in government are flourishing today, with many countries implementing programs designed to make key government information more accessible to citizens so that they can better utilize it in making personal and business decisions. While governments in more developed countries have shifted their focus to social media and sophisticated information offerings which mine large datasets, International Finance Corporation (IFC) is helping many developing countries start with the fundamentals transparency and accessibility of key information. In many of these countries, potential entrepreneurs seeking to establish business ventures in the formal economy always face a difficult question: 'what licenses and permits do I need to have for my business to operate legally, and what are the procedures for obtaining them?' This is typically a difficult path to navigate, as most countries have multiple regulatory agencies at the national, provincial and municipal levels. Also, withholding regulatory information from free public access, including charging for application forms, has been a traditional form of rent-seeking by disreputable civil servants. Thus, many entrepreneurs resort to hiring lawyers and other intermediaries to handle business registration and licensing tasks, which drives up the cost of establishing their business. This smart lesson describes a government-to-business (G2B) web portal application which IFC has pioneered through which reforming governments can help businesspeople navigate this thicket of regulations and licenses the Business Licensing e-Registry. Normally implemented as part of a larger regulatory reform program in the client country, this technology platform uses open source tools that can be easily adapted and supported by a local software developer to ensure sustainability after IFC exit. The portal can also be used to solicit public comment on new licenses or existing ones which are being targeted for reform.",https://hubs.worldbank.org/docs/imagebank/pages/docprofile.aspx?nodeid=15257343,Economy; Economy,Economic Outcomes; Gender,Bangladesh
